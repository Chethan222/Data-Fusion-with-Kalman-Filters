************************* Data Fusion ******************************
	
How does it work?

* Initial Probability Distribution increases as the car moves from initial state to final state

Two phases of data fusion :
* Prediction Step(Uncertainity increases)
* Update Stage(Uncertainity shrinks)
* Kalman Filter allows to do it numerically and mathematically simply by making some assumptions
  about the probability distribution and few other properties of the dynamic system


**************** Probability Theory *************************

Probability Distributon:

	P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

	(Total Probability = 1 )Sum of probability of all is equal to 1.

	* Mutually Exclusive	
	P(A and B) = 0 (if not => non-mutually exclusive)
	=> A and B are mutually exclusive.
	=> P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

Conditional Probability:
	=> Events are independent if the occuring of one doesn't depend on occuring of other (if not => dependent)
